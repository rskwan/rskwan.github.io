I'm a master's student studying data analysis and public policy at the
[University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu).

As an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/),
I majored in computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

I spend much of my unproductive time eating food, drinking
[pearl milk tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea), and
consuming Japanese music, often at concerts.
