Hi, I'm Ronald. I'm a master's student at UChicago studying data analysis
and public policy, as well as a full-stack web developer at
<a href="http://www.prepscholar.com/">PrepScholar</a>, in Cambridge, MA.
I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2016 with a Bachelor's
degree in computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

## Highlights

* Outside of my employment and schooling, I've worked on and off on a
variety of web development projects (mostly written in Python and
JavaScript). Most of these are described on my
<a href="{{ "/projects" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">projects page</a>.

* I've done some data analysis on my blog, on subjects including
<a href="{{ "/blog/ucb-eecs-lscs-admissions" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
freshman admissions to the two CS-related majors at Berkeley</a> and
<a href="{{ "/blog/ucb-grade-distributions" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
grade distributions for undergraduate courses at Berkeley</a>. I
expanded on the latter topic by contributing to a
<a href="http://projects.dailycal.org/grades/">visualization of
grade averages for the Daily Californian</a>.

* On the lighter side, I've also written about my experience with
<a href="{{ "/blog/berkeley-tea" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">tea-serving
establishments</a> and <a href="{{ "/blog/berkeley-food" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
restaurants</a> during my four years as a student at Berkeley.
Delicious photos included.
